            <h2><b>Review</b> <em>End of Watch</em></h2>

            <p><b>Dennis Johnson</b> <i>August 10, 2023</i></p>

            <p>When looking at movies with an action spin on things they tend to get over exaggerated and blown out of proportion. This is not the case in <em>End of Watch</em> filmed in almost a documentary style feel it can feel like the real thing going on. There is plenty of high intense situations going on as well as the sit and wait aspect of being a police officer. This movie shows raw emotion that many police officers deal with on a daily basis becoming invested and emotional with their job.</p>

            <p>The characters in this movie really bring it home for me. The main characters portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena clearly have chemistry with each other. This makes the movie feel much more dynamic when they are joking around or talking on a serious topic. This movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat during the action, laughing while they are joking around, and deeply sad in certain scenes. </p>

                <h3>Fun facts about <em>End of Watch</em></h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>As part of their training, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe単a spent five months doing 12-hour ride-alongs with on-duty LAPD officers. During Gyllenhaal's first ride-along, he witnessed a murder.</li>
                    <li>Most of the crude banter between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pe単a was improvised by the two.</li>
                    <li>The scene near the end of the movie where Mike and Brian are in pursuit of a silver minivan and then crash into it: the crash was not scripted. Michael Pe単a, who was driving the patrol car at that moment, actually crashed into the back of the minivan by accident.The director had had the anti-lock brakes removed from the patrol car because they would cause the camera to shake. Also, the actors didn't know that the road on which they were filming the scene had recently been repaved. So when Michael Pe単a hit the brakes, the patrol car skidded across the road for about a 150 feet right into the back of the minivan deploying the airbags.</li>
                    <li>In law enforcement, "end of watch" has two meanings. It commonly refers to the end of a police officer's shift. (Some agencies call shifts "watches".) It can also refer to the date of an officer's death if he is killed in the line of duty.</li>
